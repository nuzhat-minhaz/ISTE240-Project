        <h1> The Story Behind <br> the 48 year old nation.</h1>
        <h2> In 1947, British India was divided into 2 countries based on two-nation theory: Pakistan and India. Pakistan had two geographically separate parts: East Pakistan (currently known as Bangladesh) and West Pakistan (currently known as Pakistan). However, for the first time in history, the two parts of the single country were more than 2000 kilometres apart: they were separated by India down the middle.

        The two parts were very different from each other in sense of culture, language, heritage, and religious diversity.


        </h2>
        <h1>In 1952...</h1>
        <h2>The Bangla-speaking citizens of West & East Pakistan were forced to use Urdu for their day-to-day work, academics, and so on. 
        These citizens continued to be oppressed for expressing in their native language, and they eventually revolted against the Pakistani government to
        fight for the right to speak in their mother language, Bangla, on 21st February 1952. The police opened fire on the protests, thus killing several people. 
        For the first time in history, people sacrificed their lives for language.
        The government surrendered to their demands and officially recognized Bangla as one of the state languages alongside Urdu. 
        The United Nations recognized this day as International Mother Language Day to celebrate linguistic diversity around the world,
        and to protect languages and cultures from becoming extinct.
        This sparked a flicker of hope in the hearts of the oppressed Bangla-speaking citizens, who now believed in their right to have an independent nation: Bangladesh. 
        Bangla is their language. Desh means country.</h2>

        <h1>and Then Finally in 1971...</h1>
        <h2>The government of West Pakistan, the authorities of the larger land area, were continuing to systematically oppress the citizens of West Pakistan by reaping the benefits of their hard
        work by employing all educated citizens in the West, exporting valuable agricultural produce away from the fertile lands of the East, thus reducing their wealth and hurting their economy.
        On 26th March 1971, the leaders of East Pakistan declared themselves as independent Bangladesh, following which a long 9-month Liberation War ensued.
        Those fighting for the freedom of East Pakistan were mere citizens, students, and farmers, and they were up against the 
        trained army of West Pakistan. After the 8th month, India decided to assist the East by providing training to the freedom fighters.
        On December 16th 1971, West Pakistan surrendered to East Pakistan, and Bangladesh was born.
        </h2>

        <h1>Personal Note:</h1>
        <h2> My parents were alive during the war, and there was a large displacement of people in the region: people travelling from West to East or vice versa,
        and religious intolerance became more apparent in the area. As the East, now known as Bangladesh, had a crippled economy, the war left the nation poor and famine-struck.
        Bangladesh has recovered over the course of 48 years, but the poverty and suffering is apparent even to this day, and lack of education and law enforcement still exists.
        I was raised in a small developed part of the city. Outside Dhaka, most of Bangladesh consists of villages, except some districts such as Sylhet and Chittagong.
